Let m {\textgreater} 2, and 1 {\textless} r {\textless} m. Given are now Y sequences y = (y,), y’ = (yv’), . ., y+1) = (y Y(r-1)) (- w {\textless} \$1{\textless} a), and the objective is to find a cardinal spline function S(x) of degree 2m - 1, having its knots at the integers, and satisfying the conditions S(Y) = yv, S’(v) = yv’, . , S(T-l)({\textasciitilde}) = Y,({\textasciitilde}-‘) for all Y. Here we must assume that the knots of S(x) are r-fold, which means that S(x) E C2m-r-1(- 00, m). If Y = 1 we have the problem discussed in [9]. In the present paper it is shown that the interpolation problem has a unique solution that grows like a power of 1x1, provided that all data grow like a power of /VI. An analogue of the Lagrange formula is also available. Essential use is made of a theorem of Gantmacher and Krein concerning the eigenvalues of oscillation matrices (see [1] and [2; Satz 6, 1001).},

Our curve model relies on Hermite spline interpolation and can easily generate curves with sharp discontinuities; it also grants direct access to the tangent at each location. With these two features, the Hermite snake distinguishes itself from classical spline-snake models and allows one to address certain bioimaging problems in a more efﬁcient way. More precisely, the Hermite snake construction allows introducing sharp corners in the snake curve and designing directional energy functionals relying on local orientation information in the input image. Using the formalism of spline theory, the model is shown to meet practical requirements such as invariance to afﬁne transformations and good approximation properties. Finally, the dependence on initial conditions and the robustness to the noise is studied on synthetic data in order to validate our Hermite snake model, and its usefulness is illustrated on real biological images acquired using brightﬁeld, phase-contrast, differentialinterference-contrast, and scanning-electron microscopy.},

Our functions generalize the well-known polynomial Hermite B-splines and provide us with a direct control over the tangents of the parameterized contour, which is absent in traditional spline-based active contours. Our basis functions have been designed to perfectly reproduce elliptical and circular shapes. Moreover, they can approximate any closed curve up to arbitrary precision by increasing the number of anchor points. They are therefore well-suited to the segmentation of the roundish objects that are commonly encountered in the analysis of bioimages.

They are driven by application-dependent energies that reﬂect the prior knowledge on the object to be segmented. We propose an energy involving shape priors acting in a regularization-like manner. Thereby, the shape of the snake is orthogonally projected onto the space that spans the afﬁne transformations of a given shape prior. The formulation of the curves is continuous, which provides computational beneﬁts when compared with landmark-based (discrete) methods. We show that this approach improves the robustness and quality of splinebased segmentation algorithms, while its computational overhead is negligible.

We design our bases to have the shortest-possible support, subject to some constraints. Thus, computational efﬁciency is maximized. The proposed 3D snake can approximate blob-like objects with good accuracy and can perfectly reproduce spheres and ellipsoids, irrespective of their position and orientation. The optimization process is remarkably fast due to the use of Gauss’ theorem within our energy computation scheme. Our technique yields successful segmentation results, even for challenging data where object contours are not well deﬁned. This is due to our parametric approach that allows one to favor prior shapes. In addition, this paper provides a software that gives full control over the snakes via an intuitive manipulation of few control points.},

For instance, user interaction is facilitated if a geometrical object can be manipulated through control points that interpolate the shape itself. Additionally, models for shape representation often need to provide local shape control and they need to be able to reproduce common shape primitives such as ellipsoids, spheres, cylinders, or tori. We present a general framework to construct families of compactly-supported interpolators that are piecewise-exponential polynomial. They can be designed to satisfy regularity constraints of any order and they enable one to build parametric deformable shape models by suitable linear combinations of interpolators. They allow to change the resolution of shapes based on the reﬁnability of B-splines. We illustrate their use on examples to construct shape models that involve curves and surfaces with applications to interactive modeling and character design.},

Both polygon models and subdivision methods require a large number of parameters to model smooth surfaces. NURBS need fewer parameters but have a complicated rational expression and non-uniform shifts in their formulation. We present a new method to construct deformable closed surfaces, which includes exact spheres, by combining the best of two worlds: a smooth, interpolating model with a continuously varying tangent plane and well-deﬁned curvature at every point on the surface. Our formulation is considerably simpler than NURBS and requires fewer parameters than polygon meshes. We demonstrate the generality of our method with applications including intuitive user-interactive shape modeling, continuous surface deformation, shape morphing, reconstruction of shapes from parameterized point clouds, and fast iterative shape optimization for image segmentation.

A new objective function called minimal oscillation is proposed to generate the bicubic Coons surface to approximate bilinear interpolation by optimizing twists of Coons surfaces. A linear system with block tridiagonal coefﬁcient matrix is established to solve the optimal problem. The efﬁciency of the proposed method is illustrated by some numerical examples.},

We ﬁrst demonstrate that Hermite splines are maximally localized in the sense that their support sizes are minimal among pairs of functions with identical reproduction properties. Then, we precisely quantify the approximation power of Hermite splines for reconstructing functions and their derivatives, and show that they are asymptotically identical to cubic B-splines for these tasks. Hermite splines therefore combine optimal localization and excellent approximation power, while retaining interpolation properties and closed-form expression, in contrast to existing similar approaches. These ﬁndings shed a new light on the convenience of Hermite splines for use in computer graphics and geometrical design.},

Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and eﬃcient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversiﬁcation of its repertoire of applications. This survey provides a brief historical perspective on the evolution of the Bernstein polynomial basis, and a synopsis of the current state of associated algorithms and applications.},

The link is that the latter are the B-spline coefﬁcients of the former (which happen to be exponential splines). Motivated by this observation, we introduce an extended family of cardinal splines—the generalized E-splines—to generalize the concept for all convolution operators with rational transfer functions. We construct the corresponding compactly supported B-spline basis functions, which are characterized by their poles and zeros, thereby establishing an interesting connection with analog ﬁlter design techniques. We investigate the properties of these new B-splines and present the corresponding signal processing calculus, which allows us to perform continuous-time operations, such as convolution, differential operators, and modulation, by simple application of the discrete version of these operators in the B-spline domain. In particular, we show how the formalism can be used to obtain exact, discrete implementations of analog ﬁlters. Finally, we apply our results to the design of hybrid signal processing systems that rely on digital ﬁltering to compensate for the nonideal characteristics of real-world analog-to-digital (A-to-D) and D-to-A conversion systems.},
